Stock Trading & Investment Performance Analytics SystemAn end-to-end data analytics application designed to process, analyze, and visualize stock market and portfolio trading data using modern data engineering and BI tools.📌 Project OverviewIndividual traders and investment firms often deal with large volumes of raw stock market data spread across multiple sources. Manual analysis of this data is time-consuming, error-prone, and does not scale.This project addresses those challenges by building a centralized analytics system that:Automates data ingestion and processingApplies structured data cleaning and transformationsComputes portfolio performance and risk metricsDelivers interactive dashboards for decision-making🎯 Project ObjectivesBuild a Bronze–Silver–Gold data architectureAutomate ETL pipelines using Apache AirflowPerform scalable analytics using PySpark on DatabricksDeliver business-ready insights using Power BI dashboardsDemonstrate real-world financial analytics use cases🏗️ End-to-End ArchitectureData Flow:!\\\[alt text\\\](image.png)Workflow Orchestration:Apache Airflow triggers Databricks jobsA single Databricks job (stock\\\_trading\\\_etl\\\_job) contains:Bronze TaskSilver TaskGold Task🛠️ Technology StackData Processing & AnalyticsPythonPandasPySparkBig Data PlatformDatabricksDelta LakeWorkflow OrchestrationApache Airflow (Docker-based)VisualizationPower BI DesktopStorage & FormatsCSV (Raw)Delta Tables (Bronze, Silver, Gold)Version Control Git & GitHub📂 Data ScopeThe system processes the following datasets:1️⃣ Stock PricesDateTickerOpen, High, Low, CloseVolume2️⃣ Portfolio TransactionsTransaction IDDateTickerAction (BUY / SELL)QuantityPrice3️⃣ Company Sector MappingTickerSector4️⃣ Market Benchmark IndexDateOpenClose🔄 ETL Pipeline Design🥉 Bronze Layer – Raw Ingestion & ValidationNotebook : bronze\\\_ingestion.ipynbLoads raw CSV files from mounted storagePerforms:Schema inferenceNull checksInvalid value detectionBusiness rule validationsStores data as Delta tablesGenerates validation logs🥈 Silver Layer – Data Cleaning & StandardizationNotebook : silver\\\_cleaning.ipynbHandles:Null valuesInvalid prices, quantities, and datesAction standardization (BUY/SELL)Negative and zero-value filteringSeparates:Valid recordsInvalid records (for auditing)Produces clean, analytics-ready datasets🥇 Gold Layer – Business AnalyticsNotebook : gold\\\_analytics.ipynbCreates curated tables for reporting:Daily stock metrics (returns, moving averages, volatility)Portfolio holdings and market valuePortfolio trades fact tableSector-level performance metricsBenchmark vs portfolio comparisonRisk indicators (volatility, drawdowns, Sharpe-like metrics)⏱️ Workflow Automation with Apache AirflowAirflow runs inside Docker containersDAG : stock\\\_trading\\\_etl\\\_pipeline.pyA single DAG orchestrates the full pipeline:Bronze Task → Silver Task → Gold TaskUses DatabricksRunNowOperatorSupports:Scheduled runsRetries and failure handlingManual triggering for demos📊 Power BI DashboardsDashboards are built only on Gold layer tables.1️⃣ Executive DashboardTotal Portfolio ValueActive Holdings CountTotal TradesBuy vs Sell RatioPortfolio Volatility (30D)Portfolio value trendAllocation by stock2️⃣ Stock Performance & Risk AnalyticsStock price trendsDaily return analysisMoving average crossoverVolatility comparisonRisk indicators3️⃣ Market & Sector OverviewSector performance over timeSector ranking by returnsBenchmark market trendExcess returns analysis4️⃣ Portfolio & Trading AnalysisBuy vs Sell activityTrading volume over timeDrawdownsPortfolio vs benchmark comparison🔍 Key InsightsPortfolio shows strong growth with high volatilityTrading strategy is active rather than passiveConcentration risk exists in top-performing stocksTechnology and Financial sectors dominate returnsBenchmark comparison reveals mixed excess performanceRisk indicators highlight volatile assets contributing to drawdowns🚀 Future EnhancementsReal-time market data ingestion via APIsMachine learning models for price predictionAdvanced risk metrics (Beta, VaR, Sortino)Incremental & streaming pipelinesAutomated Power BI Service refreshAlerting system for abnormal market movements🚀 How to Run This Project1️⃣ Clone Repositorygit clone https://github.com/charishma6/Chubb\\\_Capstone.git2️⃣ DatabricksUpload notebooksCreate jobConnect with Airflow3️⃣ Run Airflowcd Airflowdocker compose upAccess UI: 👉 http://localhost:8080Trigger DAG: stock\\\_trading\\\_etl\\\_pipeline4️⃣ Power BIOpen Stock Trading & Investment Performance Analytics System.pbixRefresh dataExplore dashboards🏁 ConclusionThis project demonstrates a production-style data analytics pipeline that transforms raw financial data into actionable insights using modern data engineering, orchestration, and visualization tools.Thank you.Author: Charishma
